<h1 align="center">ðŸ§ª Practice Exams Platform</h1>
<br />

<div align="center">
This is a web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, CosmosDB, GraphQL and TailwindCSS. The application is a quiz
that tests your knowledge of Azure fundamentals, specifically for the AZ-900 certification exam. The questions are
stored in a Cosmos DB database and retrieved using GraphQL queries. The application is deployed on Microsoft Azure.

IMPORTANT: do not delete commented out code related to CosmosDB. We might use it to store questions soon in the future instead of from the repositories. Additionally, for the same reason let's keep Azure deployment, with that, the usage of NoSQL (CosmosDB) database is practically ready after commenting out some lines of code.
